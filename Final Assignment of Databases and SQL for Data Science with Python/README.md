## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **final practice project** focused on **analyzing a real-world dataset using SQL and Python inside Jupyter Notebook**.  
The analysis is performed using **SQL Magic**, allowing SQL queries to be executed directly within the notebook environment.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **database querying, data analysis, and insight extraction** using real data.
