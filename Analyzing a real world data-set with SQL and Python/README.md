This repository contains my **practice notebook on analyzing a real-world dataset using SQL and Python inside Jupyter Notebook**.  
The analysis is performed using **SQL Magic**, allowing SQL queries to be executed directly within notebook cells.

## 📘 About This Practice

In this notebook, I worked with real-world datasets and practiced:

- Loading SQL Magic in Jupyter Notebook
- Connecting to a SQLite database
- Exploring datasets using SQL queries
- Using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregate functions
- Combining **SQL and Python** for data analysis
- Extracting insights from real-world data
  - **Task 1:** How many rows are in the dataset?
  - **Task 2:** How many community areas in Chicago have a hardship index greater than 50.0?
  - **Task 3:** What is the maximum value of hardship index in this dataset?
  - **Task 4:** Which community area has the highest hardship index?
  - **Task 5:** Which Chicago community areas have per-capita incomes greater than $60,000?
  - **Task 6:** Create a scatter plot using the variables `per_capita_income_` and `hardship_index`. Explain the correlation between the two variables.


This practice demonstrates how SQL can be seamlessly integrated into Python-based data analysis workflows.
